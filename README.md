## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose if this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from the Vine members in the selected dataset.  

## Results
* There were 2289 Vine reviews and 4007989 non-Vine reviews
* There were 34 helpful 5-star Vine reviews and 251,101 helpful 5-star non-Vine reviews
* Out of 60 helpful Vine reviews, 34 were 5 stars: 57%.  Out of 418,284 helpful non-Vine reviews, 251,101 were 5 stars: 60%

## Summary
There was actually a lower ratio of helpful 5-star Vine reviews (57%) than helpful non-Vine 5-star reviews (60%), which implies less of a bias.  A challenge in the dataset is that there are only 60 helpful Vine reviews, so I would need reviews to make a more reliable generalization.
